1)Importance of Continuous Integration

a)Improves Quality:
Improves the quality by running multiple unit tests and analysing various static code.

b)Increases productivity:
Automating build of code saves a lot of time, there by increasing productivity.

c)Reduces Risk:
Eliminate the risk of potential human errors by automating test.


2)Introduction to Jenkins

Features of Jenkins:

a)Easy installation process
b)upgrades are easy available
c)provides advance security
d)lightweight container support
e)optimized performance
f)distributed team management

3)what is continuous Integration?
It is the process of automating the building and testing of code,each time one of the team member commits changes to version control.

CICD(continuous integration/continuous delivery(continuous deployment) delivery also known as release.

4)popular continuous Integration Tools (CICD PROCESS)
Gitlab
Jenkins
codeship
teamcity
bamboo
travisci

5)from the aws cloud if you wanted to perform the CICD, so there are various services like code commit, code deploy code guru
AWS codebuild, aws codecommit, aws codedeploy, aws code pipeline

6)From Azure cloud we have azure devops, azure  boards, azure repos, azure pipelines, azure testplans, azure artifacts.

7)what is Jenkins?(Automation server)

A continuous integration server which manages and control processes such as plan code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor in devops environment.

8)why Jenkins is so popular?
open source 
good plugin support
good community support
fast and reliable
good os support
scripted builds

9)Topics
Following are the topics covered in this module
a)Jenkins architecture
b)plugin management in Jenkins
c)Jenkins security management
d)notification in Jenkins
e)Jenkins master slave architecture
f)Jenkins delivery pipeline
g)Jenkins declarative pipeline

10)plugin managements in Jenkins:
plugin: to have extra functionality

Tabs:
a)update:shows updates to plugins already installed
b)available:shows plugins that are available for installation
c)Installed:displays plugins installed that have no updates
d)advanced: lists configuration of http proxy, allows manual upload of plugin and url of plugin site

In real time we cannot install plugins as simple as that reason being there might be challenges with proxy settings as well as vpn(virtual private network) inorder to 
avoid this we should configure http proxy in Jenkins plugin of advanced tab.

11) How to install Jenkins on windows:
