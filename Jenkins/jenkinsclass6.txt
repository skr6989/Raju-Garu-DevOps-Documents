1)Tools configuration in Jenkins

If at all we wanted to configure tools like Apache Maven Docker etc we need to go the manager Jenkins then system configuration then tools

(configure tools, their locations and automatic installers)

ex: To configure Apache maven specific version(3.6.0)

To configure Apache maven in tools tab we should install plugin Apache maven then only we can able to see maven installation in tools click on add maven then 
you can go for specific requirements to install automatically we should check the box install automatically

2)How to trigger job remotely

To configure this kind of requirement we can make use of trigger- trigger builds remotely using authentication token

create a free style job with name build remotely checkbox the trigger build remotely option and configure any build step with authentication token(aja-123)
save it and to check this job use the below url.

syntax remote url: JENKINS_URL/JOB/buildremotely/build?token=TOKEN_NAME

where JENKINS_URL is where JENKINS is listening or accessible build remotely is jobname. TOKEN_NAME is authentication token which we configured

Ex:localhost:8999/job/buildremotely/build?token=aja-123

3)Anotherway of triggering the job remotely
In order to trigger job (example job2). we can go for the below command

curl -u admin:<API_TOKEN> -X POST localhost:8999/job/job2/build

where -u is user (admin)

APITOKEN which has to be generated with the user admin POST is a method to call the url.
