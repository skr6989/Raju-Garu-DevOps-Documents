1) Apache TomCat Folder Structure

conf-configuration
bin-binary (to start and stop the server)
webapps-hosting the application
logs-server logs
lib-libraries
temp-temporary files


2)How to access the application url:
127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080
<url of TomCat>/<ArtifactName>
Ex:localhost:8080/aja 
where "aja"-->Artifact Name

3) To create project in maven:
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.helloworld -DartifactId=helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false

4)How we can place the artifact from the maven project of target folder to apache tomcat webapp folder:
cp <pathwhereartifact> <path where webapps of tomcat>
cp <source> <destination>
<destinationfolder> cp/<source> .

while copying use forward slash "/"

4)If we do any configuration changes we need to restart the server
To change the port number of tomcat server we need to stop and start server
To stop tomcat ctrl+c

5)To deploy the application anotherway is by using the tomcat gui
Access the url of tomcat then search for the .war file to deploy
click on choose file it will open dialogbox in dialogbox we need to select the artifact and click on open then we need to click on deploy button

6)how can we access apache tomcat GUI go to tomcat home folder
home folder of apache tomcat -->conf
modify "tomcat-user.xml"(using text editor eg:vi)
vi tomcat-user.xml (we need to search for the line)<user username="admin"
need to uncomment these lines -- "<!--" "-->"
once we modify tomcat-user.xml file save and quit

7)what is the difference between pom.xml and settings.xml
Use pom.xml to define dependencies, plugins, and configurations specific to a project.
Use settings.xml to configure Maven behavior globally, such as repository authentication and proxy settings.
