Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)

1)Traditional Water Fall Model:

Requirements and Gathering Analysis(customer requirements)

Design(Tools/CICD)

Implement (code, System, RegTest)

Test(UAT)

Deploy(Release)

Maintenance (Bug fixing, support)

2) What is Agile Methodology?

i. In the Agile methodology each project is broken up in to several iterations.
ii. All iterations should be of the same time duration(between 2 to 8 weeks).
iii. At the end of each iteration a working product should be delivered. 

suitable for complex projects

3)minimum viable product (mvp)

4) Limitations of Agile:

Development team wants change

Operations Team wants stability

Development Team: code works fine in my laptop

Operation Team: There is some problem with the code, it does not work in production

5)Development with out DevOps culture:

Release and Deploy mismatch

unpredictable issues

Blame Game

Lack of monitoring

6) Development with DevOps Culture:

i) Streamlined Deliveries
ii) Team work in collaboration
iii) Continuous monitoring and Feedback

7)what need to be in done?
Developers: 
use system with little or no waiting time
use system with updated code
Operations:
System should be up and running most of the time
System required for easy administration
Effective monitoring and feedbacks
system should be established

8) what DevOps is not?

DevOps is not a role, person or organisation

DevOps is not a separate team

DevOps is not a product or a tool

DevOps is not about just writing scripts or implementing tools

9) what is DevOps?

DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, that is development, testing, deployment and monitoring

10) What does DevOps do?

Integrates developers and operations teams improves collaboration and productivity by:
Automating infrastructure
Automating workflows
Continuously measuring application performance
