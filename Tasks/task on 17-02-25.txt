1)What happens when we turn on computer?

The power supply sends electricity to the components of the computer, such as the motherboard, hard drive, and fans.
The BIOS (basic input/output system) or UEFI initializes and performs a power-on self-test (POST), which checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly. If any issues are detected, error messages may be displayed.
The operating system (OS), such as Windows or macOS, is loaded from the hard drive or another storage device into the computer’s RAM (random access memory).
The OS then initializes its own components and drivers and presents the login screen or desktop environment to the user.

2) In Linux, GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix". It is a recursive acronym, meaning the first letter stands for the acronym itself.

3)GNU is a free and open-source software project started by Richard Stallman in 1983 under the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The goal was to create a Unix-like operating system that was completely free for users to modify, distribute, and use.

4)The ext (Extended File System) family consists of a series of file systems used in Linux operating systems. They evolved over time to improve performance, reliability, and feature support. Here's a breakdown of each:

1. ext (Extended File System)
First introduced in 1992.
The first filesystem designed specifically for Linux.
Had many limitations, including poor performance and lack of key features like journaling.
2. ext2 (Second Extended File System)
Introduced in 1993.
Improved performance over ext.
Does NOT support journaling, meaning after a crash, the system needs to perform a full filesystem check.
Used in USB drives and SD cards due to its simplicity and low overhead.
3. ext3 (Third Extended File System)
Introduced in 2001.
Added journaling, reducing the risk of data loss during crashes.
Backward compatible with ext2 (can be mounted as ext2 if journaling is disabled).
Not as fast as other modern file systems.
4. ext4 (Fourth Extended File System)
Introduced in 2008.
Supports larger file sizes (up to 16 TB) and larger volumes (up to 1 EB).
More efficient storage allocation with delayed allocation and multi-block allocation.
Backward compatible with ext3 and ext2.
Faster and more reliable than ext3, making it the default Linux filesystem in most distributions.

Which One Should You Use?
ext2: Best for USB drives and SD cards (to reduce write operations).
ext3: Only if you're working with an old Linux system.
ext4: Recommended for modern Linux systems due to performance and reliability



Linux directory structure
/ – The root directory
/bin – Binaries
/dev – Device files
/etc – Configuration files
/usr(unix sharable resource) – User binaries and program data
/home – User personal data
/lib – Shared libraries
/sbin – System binaries
/tmp – Temporary files
/var – Variable data files
/boot – Boot files
/proc – Process and kernel files
/opt – Optional software
/root – The home directory of the root
/media – Mount point for removable media
/mnt – Mount directory
/srv – Service data


what are the some special files that represent hardware devices, system information etc

In Linux, special files are used to represent hardware devices, system information, and process management. These files are typically found in directories like /dev, /proc, and /sys. Here’s an overview of the important ones:

Special File	         Purpose
/dev/sda, /dev/sdb	Hard drives
/dev/null	       Discards all data
/dev/zero	       Generates null bytes
/dev/tty	       Terminal interface
/proc/cpuinfo	       CPU details
/proc/meminfo	       Memory usage
/sys/class/net/	       Network interfaces
