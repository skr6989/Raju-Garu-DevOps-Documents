1)Maven through Terminal

Install the maven tar file after verifying the signature

After installing the maven, check its version from ubuntu terminal by using the below command

mvn -version

Below command will create a project using maven

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=helloworld -D archetype ArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -Dinteractivemode=false

2)Maven Lifecycle phases(8 phases)

validate:checks if the project is correct, having all the necessary information

mvn validate

compile:compile the source code of the project

mvn compile

test:test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed

mvn test

package: take the compiled code and package if in its distributable format such as JAR

mvn package

integration-test:process and deploy the package in to an environment where integration tests can be run

mvn integration-test

verify:run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria

mvn verify

install: install the package into the local repository for use as a dependency in other projects locally 

mvn install

deploy:done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects

mvn deploy

3) what is .m2 folder?

it is local repository of the apache maven
c:/users/username/m2

Apache maven has an advantage that is when we run any of the life cycle phases it will also include previous phases as well 

example if we run mvn package (4th phase) it will also run previous phases as well(validate, compile, test)
